# Learning React Native

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.

## Setup from scratch

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started>

## Setup

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
cd learning-react-native
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm start
# hit the "w" key to run in browser
# http://192.168.0.165:19006/
# open developer tools and choose a mobile device

```
